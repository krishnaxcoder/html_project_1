                  <span>OUR APPROACH</span> is dynamic and thorough. We
                  understand that our clients’ needs and preferences are unique.
                  This drives us to design each project from scratch, which
                  keeps us in a constant state of creative discovery. We work
                  holistically and consider every detail. This involves
                  establishing an overall aesthetic direction, thinking through
                  the circulation and layout of each space, designing interior
                  architectural elements, specifying finishes, fixtures,
                  furniture, accessories, and art. To ensure the design intent
                  is seen through to the very end, we know our involvement in
                  every phase is key. From conceptual design through
                  construction administration to the very last furniture
                  installation, we want to be there.
